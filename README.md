<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Currently, I'm working on this application which would help Ukrainian people by allowing them to send text messages to Russian phone numbers with text messages describing an actual and real situation in Ukraine. This is, due to Russian restrictions, impossible now.

The second part of an application will be the messaging system itself, which allows Ukraine supporters from all over the world to act as a proxy.
